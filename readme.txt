Central dashboard for managing all JezPress plugins, licenses, and support.

== Description ==

JezPress Manager provides a unified dashboard for all your JezPress plugins. Instead of navigating to different settings pages scattered throughout the WordPress admin, access all your JezPress plugins from one convenient location.

= Features =

* **Centralized Dashboard** - View all installed JezPress plugins in one place
* **License Management** - Monitor license status for all your plugins at a glance
* **Quick Support Access** - Easy access to documentation, support, and your account
* **Clean Interface** - Modern, responsive design that integrates with WordPress admin

= For Plugin Developers =

Other JezPress plugins can register themselves with the manager using a simple API:

`
JezPress_Manager::register( array(
    'slug'           => 'my-plugin-settings',
    'name'           => 'My Plugin Name',
    'version'        => '1.0.0',
    'menu_title'     => 'My Plugin',
    'capability'     => 'manage_options',
    'callback'       => array( 'My_Plugin_Admin', 'render_settings' ),
    'license_status' => 'active', // 'active', 'expired', 'invalid', or ''
) );
`

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `jezpress-manager` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Access the JezPress Manager from the admin menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need this plugin? =

If you use multiple JezPress plugins, this manager provides a convenient central location to access all of them. If you only use one JezPress plugin, it's optional but still provides a cleaner admin experience.

= Will my plugins still work without this? =

Yes. JezPress plugins are designed to work independently. The manager simply provides a unified interface.
